NCurses for Go

Build Instructions:
    Should just be a simple make && make install (possibly with a sudo thrown
in for good measure). It's only been tested to build on Ubuntu 10.10x64, so
your mileage may vary. Unfortunately, I don't really get Makefiles and the
build ideology of C, so I probably can't help with build failures and such.

January 9th:
    The first commit. Has basic functionality, missing a few major pieces, and
the constants that I stole need a pretty major overhaul to be easy to use.
Mouse constants look fairly pretty though. I'm planning on continuing the port
and getting 90% or more of the functionality that curses supports, as well as
somewhat of an abstraction layer to make colors, windows, pads, and other such
stuff easier to use and implement. I'm not currently planning on making
extensions for the extra packages such as panels or menus, since those are easy
enough to implement on your own.
    Also on the list for the future is a masking system of some kind so that
one can use PDCurses, NCurses, and etcCurses all without ever caring what
curses is installed. This will definitely be for the latest versions of those
only, as I don't have the time to handle 6-10 versions of each kind of curses.
SVr4 will be the implementation standard once I start fiddling with that, then
having added components that the other projects put on top of that.
